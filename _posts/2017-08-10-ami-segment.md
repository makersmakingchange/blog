<p><strong><em>Though our segment is at the beginning, we’d recommend you should watch the whole episode &mdash; they profile a whole bunch of cool accessibility initiatives across Canada.</em></strong></p>

<p>As Fall approaches, we’ve hosted eight Buildathons across Canada and the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, and are finalizing a number of Buildathons which we've lined up for the coming months of 2017. But we’re still looking to do more. If you or your organization is interested in hosting or helping fund your own LipSync Buildathon, please feel free to contact&nbsp;<a title="email Chad Leaman" href="mailto:chadl@neilsquire.ca">chadl@neilsquire.ca</a>.</p>
