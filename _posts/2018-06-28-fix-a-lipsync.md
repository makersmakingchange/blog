title: Fix a LipSync

---
Next week, we’ll meet our old friends at <a title="Visit the VHS website" href="https://vanhack.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vancouver Hack Space (VHS)</a> to repair and complete a bunch of LipSyncs. Not every device is finished at our buildathons, and we periodically organize fix-it nights so community members can help us complete them.

By volunteering to troubleshoot a LipSync, you help a person with a disability (who may be quadriplegic or have limited use of their hands) gain access to a touchscreen device. Plus: around 6pm, we'll get pizza for our volunteers.

PS: Do you have a chronic condition/disability or care for someone who does? The UBC Health Mentors Program is looking for Health Mentors to share their medical expertise with healthcare students. Mentors meet students twice a semester over a 16-month term, and share their expertise on living with a chronic condition.

Applications are open till August 13th, 2018. <a title="Learn more about the program" href="https://pcpe.health.ubc.ca/healthmentors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about being a Health Mentor on the UBC website.</a>
