title: Tacoma Buildathon

---

<p>We have another Stateside Buildathon coming up, and this one’s close to home &mdash; we’ll be in the Pacific Northwest just outside of Seattle in beautiful Tacoma, Washington on Monday, July 31<sup>st</sup>.<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14386 lazy" title="a poster for the Tacoma Buildathon" src="http://www.neilsquire.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FabLab-Tacoma-LetterSized-1024x791.jpg"><strong><em>We’re starting to get quite well acquainted with the Pacific Northwest.</em></strong></p>
<p>This Buildathon will be a little different, however. We’ll be seeing a lot of Washington-based educators, who can receive continuing education credits from <a title="go to the Pacific Lutheran University website" href="https://www.plu.edu/" target="_blank">Pacific Lutheran University</a> for attending this event. <a title="go to FabLab Tacoma's website" href="https://fablabtacoma.com/" target="_blank">FabLab Tacoma</a>, who we partnered with to bring a Buildathon to Tacoma and are hosting the event, saw this as an opportunity for educators to learn about Buildathons and maker culture, and potentially add them to their curriculums. We’re hoping this leads to more Buildathons involving students in Washington, like <a title="read about our first school Buildathon in Burnaby" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-burnaby-school-district-makeathon/" target="_blank">the ones we’ve done in Burnaby</a>.</p>
