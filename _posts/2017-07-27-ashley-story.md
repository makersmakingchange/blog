title: Ashley's Story

---

We have another great <a title="learn more about the Access Makeathon" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com/accessmakeathonsummary/" target="_blank">Access Makeathon</a> story to show. While we’ve previewed Ashley’s story at a handful of events, this is the first time it’s available publicly. We think that this story is great in that it shows how Ashley was an active participant in the process — it was very much a collaborative effort between her and the makers. It also shows the wide range of things, whether it seems big or small, that could really improve a person’s life — that a maker could make. Have a look here:

<strong><em>Thank you to Ashley for participating in this video and taking such an interest in the Makers Making Change initiative. </em></strong>

We are looking forward to doing more open-style Maker events in the coming months. With that in mind, we are happy to announce that we will be a headline sponsor of the <a title="learn more about the Tikkun Olam Makers (TOM): Alberta Makeathon 2017" href="http://tomglobal.org/makeathons/2017/8/24/tomcalgary-2017" target="_blank">Tikkun Olam Makers (<abbr title="Tikkun Olam Makers">TOM</abbr>): Alberta Makeathon 2017</a> from August 24<sup>th </sup>- 27<sup>th </sup>in Calgary. We had initially come into contact with <abbr title="Tikkun Olam Makers">TOM</abbr>, who are a global movement that put together Makeathons similar to our Access Makeathon, in <a title="read about our time at the Bay Area Maker Faire, where we first met the Tikkun Olam Makers" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-bay-area-maker-faire/" target="_blank">San Francisco earlier this year</a>, and are happy to be working with them in Calgary. As part of the Makeathon, there will be a <a title="learn more about our LipSync project" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/research-development/projects-activities/lipsync/" target="_blank">LipSync</a> Buildathon. We are hoping this is a successful first step into Alberta.
