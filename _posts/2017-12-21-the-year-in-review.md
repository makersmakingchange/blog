title: The Year in Review

---
What a fantastic year it has been. We started off with the <a title="Read more about the Access Makeathon" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-summary-access-makeathon/" target="_blank">Access Makeathon</a>, a 48-hour challenge where Makers worked together to create innovative assistive technologies for people with disabilities. And then we spent the entire year hopping around North America to meet dedicated Makers and build devices.

We hosted or co-hosted <strong>17 events,</strong> of which five were in the United States. With the help of many bright Makers, students, engineers, and tinkerers, we built <strong>320 LipSyncs</strong> this year!
