March 17th is World Create Day: a day when hackers and makers get together in their communities to collaborate on projects for social change.

Our Makers Making Change team will be part of WCD events in Vancouver, Regina, and Toronto. Specifically, we’ll be at <a title="Learn more about our WCD Vancouver plans" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com/event/hackaday-world-create-day-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vancouver Hack Space</a>, <a title="Learn more about WCD at CrashBang Labs" href="https://crashbanglabs.wildapricot.org/event-2853947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrashBang Labs</a>, and <a title="Read more about Tetra Ryerson's event" href="http://www.tetraryerson.ca/2018-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryerson University</a>. We are quite excited about WCD kicking off the first-ever Makers Making Change event in Saskatchewan!

Don’t live in one of these cities? You can search <a title="Check out World Create Day events around the world" href="https://hackaday.io/meetup/4-world-create-day-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Hackaday map</a> for meetups in your area – or even organize your own. Either way, it’s a fantastic opportunity to collaborate and engage with makers in your community.

We hope to see you there!
