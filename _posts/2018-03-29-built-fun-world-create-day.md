title: We Built and Had Fun on World Create Day

---
On <a title="Read more about World Create Day" href="https://hackaday.com/tag/world-create-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Create Day</a>, we worked on some (very cool) projects that would empower people with disabilities. In Vancouver, we created custom video game controllers, prototyped exo-skeleton arms, and repaired <a title="Learn more about the LipSync" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/research-development/projects-activities/lipsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LipSyncs</a>.

We were joined by students and volunteers. Here’s the team in action:

Thank you for helping us build something that matters.
