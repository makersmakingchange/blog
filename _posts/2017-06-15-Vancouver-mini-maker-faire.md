title: Vancouver Mini Maker Faire

---

It’s good to be home — for now. Before heading out for a number of events on the road for the last few weeks of June, it was good to be at the [Vancouver Mini Maker Faire](http://vancouver.makerfaire.com/) right near home, and in our local community.

It was great to talk to the community, getting the chance to meet with a whole of new faces.

But it also gave us time to reconnect with some “old” friends. We got a chance to catch up with a lot of the people who helped make the [Access Makeathon](http://www.makersmakingchange.com/accessmakeathonsummary/) so successful. Many of the individual makers, and organizing partners including [SFU SIAT](http://www.sfu.ca/siat.html), [Vancouver Hack Space](https://vanhack.ca/), [RP Electronics](http://www.rpelectronics.com/) were there at the PNE Forum with us Saturday and Sunday.

<em>In addition to the previously announced Philadelphia LipSync Buildathon this Sunday, we’ve added a couple of US Buildathons in the next few weeks as part of the Nation of Makers’ Week of Making. Both are in Washington State. The first is in Seattle this Sunday (the same day as the Philadelphia one), while we have one in Bellingham on the following Saturday (the 24th).</em>

<em>If you happen to be in the area for any of the three Buildathons mentioned — [Philadelphia](https://nextfab.com/event/lipsync-buildathon/), [Seattle](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sodo-lipsync-buildathon-tickets-34958170830), and [Bellingham](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-foundry-lipsync-buildathon-registration-34788474263) — they are still looking for both people to make LipSyncs, and people who need LipSyncs. The events are open to the public, so you can even just come and watch. Click the previous links on the city names for more information and to register.</em>
