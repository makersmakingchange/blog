title: TELUS Staff Build 175 LipSyncs

---

Last week, we wrapped up our TELUS Days of Giving LipSync Buildathons. Some incredible TELUS team members helped us build <strong>175 LipSyncs</strong> over the past month and a half!

These LipSyncs are available for free in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. If you live in these provinces and are waiting on or want to trial a LipSync, please get in touch! Email Zee at <a title="Email Zee" href="mailto:zeek@neilsquire.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zeek@neilsquire.ca</a> and she’ll help you out.

Here are a few photos recapping our buildathons. <a title="View the Facebook album" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10156503955190859.1073741920.87448305858&amp;type=1&amp;l=ea66335a11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out our Facebook album for more photos.</a>

Thank you, TELUS, for your leadership and support in hosting these LipSync Buildathons, enabling us to create assistive solutions for people with disabilities all over Canada.

PS: We’re at the <a title="Visit the conference website" href="http://caot.ca/site/pd/conf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><abbr title="Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists">CAOT Conference</abbr></a> all week. Zee hosted a pre-conference workshop yesterday introducing maker skills to occupational therapists. It focused on using 3D modelling, 3D printing, and creating switch adapted toys. <a title="View a switch adapted" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjnXYE-nI2i/?taken-by=makersmakingchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s a peek at one such switch adapted toy</a>.
