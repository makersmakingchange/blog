The BC SCI Community Services Network is a collective of five organizations that frequently work together and share similar goals — [Spinal Cord Injury BC](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=83049220fa&e=d7810b5dca) , [the BC Wheelchair Basketball Society](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=e72d312dca&e=d7810b5dca) , [the BC Wheelchair Sports Association](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=b8012f756f&e=d7810b5dca) , [the Sam Sullivan Disability Foundation](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=4541fbf662&e=d7810b5dca) , and Neil Squire Society. Many of the people we serve, benefit from the services of the other organizations, and vice versa. Rather than being competitive, we collaborate — we work together.

The goal of the meet-up is to network and share with each other our new and exciting projects. We’ll largely focus on sharing the LipSync. In the spirit of that aforementioned collaboration, we will be looking to connect with people in our community — BC — who need a LipSync. As well, we will be looking for people to help make LipSyncs. (The Tetra Society, an affiliated society of the Sam Sullivan Disability Foundation, in particular has similar goals as a network of makers who create assistive technology for people with disabilities).
