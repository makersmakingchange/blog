title: Help Us Print Low Tech AT Kits

---
Makers Making Change has started reaching out to Occupational Therapists (OTs). <abbr title="Occupational Therapists">OTs</abbr> work directly with people with disabilities and can connect them with our services, giving people access to more affordable, community-made assistive devices.
<h2>Help Us Print Low Tech AT Kits</h2>

Our Low Tech AT Kits are composed of simple 3D-printed devices from our Open Source Assistive Technology Library. We will share these kits with <abbr title="Occupational Therapists">OTs</abbr>, whose clients will be able to try out the devices. This will help us get valuable feedback on how well these devices function and how they can be improved to meet the needs of people with disabilities.
