title: Sustainability TV Filming

---
On Wednesday, November 22nd, <a title="Visit the Sustainability Television website" href="https://www.sustainabilitytelevision.com/">Sustainability Television</a> visited our Burnaby office to film a segment. The segment will focus on Neil Squire Society and Makers Making Change. It won’t be broadcast until September 2018, but we were excited to be a part of it!

Here are some photos:

We also want to talk about the <a href="http://makechangeconference.com/">Make Change Conference</a> in Toronto on November 12th. Zee presented alongside Sorlie Madox, a talented artist and potter with multiple sclerosis, and Kat Singer, a multi-disciplinary community-based artist, activist, and educator.

Together they discussed making for, with, and as people with disabilities. It was great to see how many passionate makers and organizers are involved in the Toronto maker community.
