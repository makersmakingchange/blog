title: What AT Can Help Students with Disabilities?

---
We are currently working on expanding our <a title="Visit the Makers Making Change assistive technology library" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source assistive technology library</a> by adding devices that can help youth. We have some questions for teachers to help us get started.

What disabilities do your students have? Are there any assistive devices you can think of that would be a valuable addition to your classroom? If your students are already working with some assistive technology, click a photo of the device and send it to us!
