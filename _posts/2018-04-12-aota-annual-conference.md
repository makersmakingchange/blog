Our Makers Making Change team will be making a beeline for Salt Lake City, Utah, to attend the <a title="Visit the AOTA Conference page" href="https://www.aota.org/Conference-Events/annual-conference.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Annual Conference</a> April 19–22. There, we'll be connecting with occupational therapists and local resource organizations to spread the message of open-source technologies benefitting people with disabilities.

We're excited to add that we'll be hosting a pre-conference workshop on Wednesday, April 18th: <strong><em>The Occupational Therapist’s Maker Toolbox: DIY Assistive Technology Solutions in the Clinic</em></strong>. Attendees will learn about 3D-printing, soldering, and making different assistive technology solutions.

Last year was our first time at the AOTA Conference and we discovered there was huge interest in the concept of making. Some occupational therapists who had been in the industry for over 30 to 40 years spoke about their experiences with tinkering in order to create their own assistive solutions.

We're looking forward to connecting with even more occupational therapists and local resource groups this year, furthering our goal of connecting people with disabilities to makers.
