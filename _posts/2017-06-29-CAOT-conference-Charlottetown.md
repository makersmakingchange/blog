title: The CAOT Conference in Charlottetown

---

<p>Wow! June was one busy month. We capped off a month of Buildathons, Maker Faires, and outreach with a trip to Charlottetown, <abbr title="Prince Edward Island">PEI</abbr> (and the surrounding area) for the 2017 <a title="learn more about the Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists" href="https://www.caot.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists</a> (<abbr title="Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists">CAOT</abbr>) <a title=" learn more about the 2017 Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists" href="https://www.caot.ca/site/pd/conf2017?nav=sidebar">Conferenc<span class="blind_text">e</span></a>, similar to the <a title="learn more about our first time in Philadelphia" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-aota/" target="_blank">American Occupational Therapist Association conference we attended in Philadelphia</a>.

</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, we connected with occupational therapists across the United States and Canada and we created connections and roots in the city and surrounding areas with local MakerSpaces, rehabilitation clinics, and interested people. It’s allowed us to host <a title="learn more about our Philadelphia Buildathon" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-stateside-buildathons/">Buildathons</a> and really be visible in Philadelphia — it paved the way for a lot of progress.
</p>
<p>At the <abbr title="Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists">CAOT</abbr> conference in PEI, we aimed to replicate the outreach we achieved in Philadelphia. Highlights included meeting with and giving <a title="learn more about the LipSync project" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/research-development/projects-activities/lipsync/" target="_blank">LipSyncs</a> to the <a title="learn more about the University of Prince Edward Island" href="http://www.upei.ca/" target="_blank">University of Prince Edward Island<span class="blind_text"></span></a>and their disability services office, and <a title="learn more about Spinal Cord Injury Prince Edward Island" href="http://www.sci-pei.ca/" target="_blank">Spinal Cord Injury Prince Edward Island<span class="blind_text"></span></a>. Rather coincidentally, Saturday was the <a title="learn more about the Prince Edward Island Walk for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis" href="http://alspei.ca/walk-for-als/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Prince Edward Island">PEI</abbr> Walk for <abbr title="Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis">ALS</abbr><span class="blind_text"></span></a>, where we connected with a Maritimes service provider, <a title="learn more about Harding Medical" href="http://www.hardingmedical.com/index.aspx" target="_blank">Harding Medical<span class="blind_text"></span></a>, and gave them a LipSync.
</p>
<p>We also dropped off an unassembled LipSync kit with the <a title="learn more about the Summerside MakerSpace" href="http://summersidemakerspace.ca/" target="_blank">Summerside MakerSpace<span class="blind_text"> </span></a>which they are currently building. The MakerSpaces we met were very enthusiastic and willing to help.

<p>While we have talked mostly about our activities outside the conference, the conference itself was a huge success. Just as we had experienced in Philadelphia, occupational therapists were tremendously interested in the LipSync and <a title="learn more about Makers Making Change" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com/" target="_blank">Makers Making Change<span class="blind_text"></span></a>. We made good contact with an occupational therapist or school in literally every province of Canada — and sometimes more, we met many from Nova Scotia and Alberta for instance. It’s a great launching point.
</p>
<p>These conferences provide a very efficient way to grow our networks and grow the initiative, allowing us to meet people from all over the country, rather than having to go to each community individually to make connections. Not that we don’t enjoy travelling to each different community — we’ll be doing that in our follow-up with many of our new connections.  (We are looking forward, however, to next year’s <abbr title="Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists">CAOT</abbr> conference being in Vancouver — a huge opportunity).

</p>
<p>Rounding out our week, we were also in Bellingham, Washington, co-ordinating another successful build. Thanks to <a title="learn more about The Foundry MakerSpace" href="http://www.bellinghamfoundry.com/">The Foundry MakerSpace<span class="blind_text"></span></a>, our gracious hosts, we now have another 17 LipSyncs built.
</p>
<p>After the final LipSync build of the month, it’s nice to look back — we built nearly 90 LipSyncs in June alone. We’re getting close to the 150 we’ve aimed to build during our first phase. Now, it’s time to really start getting them out to people on a large scale. For us, July will be a lot calmer, at least in terms of events, so over the next few weeks we’re going to be doing some quality assurance and work on getting the LipSyncs out there.
