title: Summary of the Access Makeathon

---

That was a great weekend. At the Access Makeathon, I saw some brilliant innovation, I saw people working together — it really epitomized the bigger picture that we're working towards with the LipSync. We saw engaged members of the community — makers, university students, people from many walks of life — come together and work towards bettering peoples' lives. It was truly magical. And a lot of fun too.

But it's a bit tough to explain in just words.

So we [created a crowd-sourced collage of various postings on social media](http://www.makersmakingchange.com/accessmakeathonsummary/)  from the #MakeAccess hashtag over the weekend. We'll share the videos as they come too.

<em><strong>A team of makers hard at work, with some of our LipSync team helping out. For more pictures of the event or to add yours to the colletion, go the Access [Makeathon Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1867670313510437/)  or tag them on twitter or instagram with #MakeAccess.</strong></em> 

Starting next week, I'll get back to updating you on the progress of the LipSync, but I hope you enjoyed the Access Makeathon as much as I did.

Sincerely,

Chad Leaman
