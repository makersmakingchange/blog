title: Meet Fawzan, a 16-Year-Old Maker

---
Grade 10 student Fawzan has founded <a href="https://youthforcare.com/">Fraser Heights Youth for CARE</a>, a student group that raises awareness of Surrey Memorial Hospital while engaging youth in the community.

Fawzan and his group 3D-printed pen balls, palm pen holders, bottle openers, and other devices from our <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/makersmakingchange/designs">open-source Assistive Technology Library</a> to help people with disabilities.

Fawzan says:<em> "I strive to follow Mahatma Gandhi's advice: be the change you wish to see in this world. I wish to use my knowledge and skills to help and make a positive change in my community. I also like to encourage my peers to assist others in need."</em>

We're glad youth like Fawzan are coming together to do some good in their communities. We hope to continue hearing such amazing stories throughout the year!
