title: Testing, Testing...

---

We're having a busy and fun time doing a lot of backend work here at Makers Making Change. One of our projects: testing and fixing a whole bunch of <a title="Learn more about the LipSync" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/lipsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LipSyncs</a> to make sure they are functioning brilliantly before being sent to people who need them.

On that note, if you or someone you know who could benefit from a LipSync, please get in touch with Zee at <a href="mailto:zeek@neilsquire.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zeek@neilsquire.ca</a>.

We are glad to have Fawzan’s help in testing these LipSyncs. As you may remember, Fawzan is a high school student who, along with his student group, 3D-printed assistive devices from our library for people with disabilities. <a title="Read Fawzan's story" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/success-story/meet-fawzan-a-16-year-old-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Fawzan’s work.</a>

You won't hear from us as often in the next few weeks while we work on these projects. In the meantime, you can always give us a shout or <a title="Visit the Makers Making Change website" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get involved on our website</a>. Have a bright rest-of-the-summer!
