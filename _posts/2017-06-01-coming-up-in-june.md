title: Coming up in June

---

After closing out May with a series of Maker Faires — [the Bay Area Maker Faire](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=f568844790&e=d7810b5dca)  and the Sunshine Coast Mini Maker Faire — we’re headed for a busy June full of events and Buildathons. It’s time for outreach and making.

We will kick off the month by hosting a LipSync Buildathon on Friday and Saturday at the Innovation Centre at Telus Garden in Vancouver. We will be on hand to support 15 Telus volunteers each day as they build LipSyncs.

Then, after the success of [the first one](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=c7d08143b2&e=d7810b5dca) , we’ve decided to host another Burnaby School District LipSync Buildathon. It will take place on Wednesday, June 7th at Burnaby South Secondary School. We're aiming to have 50 students build 25 LipSyncs.

We will be taking part in the [Vancouver Mini Maker Faire](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=2c01902061&e=d7810b5dca)  on June 10th and 11th.

Executive Director, Gary Birch, will be a panelist at the [M-Enabling Summit](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=048a19f57a&e=d7810b5dca) , a global conference on promoting “accessible technologies and environments for senior citizens and persons with disabilities,” held in Washington, D.C. on June 14th and 15th. Gary will be talking about the Makers Making Change initiative and the LipSync in front of an audience of over 500 influential persons and industry leaders.

The Makers Making Change team will then travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where we have partnered with NextFab to host the [Philadelphia LipSync Buildathon](https://nextfab.com/event/lipsync-buildathon/?utm_source=LipSync+Update&utm_campaign=ccfd718c6a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_05_30&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_af948441ae-ccfd718c6a-254130653)  on June 18th.

Back in the beginning of April we went to the [American Occupational Therapists Association Annual Conference](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=640778edd1&e=d7810b5dca) . While from June 20th – 24th we’ll be in Charlottetown, PEI to attend the [2017 Canadian Association of Occupation Therapists (CAOT) Conference](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=9306e36130&e=d7810b5dca) . This is important as occupational therapists are one of our biggest audiences in terms of outreach, as they recommend and apply assistive technology solutions to their clients. The American conference was tremendously successful in terms of interest and connections made, and we expect the CAOT conference to be no different.

Our Director of Research and Development, Harry Lew, will be presenting at the RESNA (Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America) [2017 Annual Conference](http://neilsquire.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d23a18433c4afe9206139e240&id=566717429b&e=d7810b5dca)  in New Orleans, Louisiana from June 26th – 30th. Harry will be comparing different open source models, and how the Makers Making Change model incorporates the strengths and works to overcome the weaknesses of previous models.

It’s shaping up to be a busy month, but we’re looking forward to it.
