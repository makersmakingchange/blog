title: We Fixed 67 LipSyncs

---
On Monday, December 4th, we were at <a title="Visit the Vancouver Hack Space website" href="http://vanhack.ca/" target="_blank">Vancouver Hack Space</a> to repair a few LipSyncs. “A few” turned out to be 67: that’s how many LipSyncs are up and running now with the help of some fantastic Makers, all in 10 hours.

The completed LipSyncs are on their way to people who need them. A big thank you to everyone who came out to troubleshoot with us!
