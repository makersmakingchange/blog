We are pleased to introduce Zee Kesler, our <a title="Visit the Makers Making Change website" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makers Making Change</a> Project Manager. Zee calls herself a Maker Educator. She has been an active participant in maker educator spaces since the first Vancouver Mini Maker Faire in 2011.

Zee recently found out that she has a connective tissue disorder called <a title="Learn more about Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlersâ€“Danlos_syndromes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome</a>. She decided to get involved with Makers Making Change as a way to get more comfortable with having a disability, but also because she loves <em>"maker culture, crowd-sourcing ideas, creating community, and being involved in innovative social programming."</em>

Zee has co-founded/founded two mobile classrooms: the MakerMobile, which is a mobile hackspace, and the <a title="Visit the Magic Trout Imaginarium website" href="https://www.magictroutimaginarium.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Trout Imaginarium</a>, which is a mobile classroom in a tiny house.

Zee has been with us since September 2017, but it's still a good time to say we are thrilled to have her on board!
