title: CSUN Assistive Technology Conference

---

Next week, I’m going to be in San Diego. But, as usual, it’s not for fun — though I’m sure it will be. I will be presenting at the 32nd annual CSUN (California State University Northridge) [Assistive Technology Conference](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2017/sessions/index.php/) .

The CSUN Assistive Technology Conference is the largest and longest running conference focusing on assistive technologies to help people with disabilities. It regularly draws 4,500+ people a year, and brings together a wide range of people from researchers to practitioners to users.

I will be presenting on how low-cost electronics and 3D printers allow makers to design affordable custom access solutions with people with disabilities to meet their goals.

Presenting with me is [DIYAbility](http://diyability.org/pages/about)’s John Schimmel. We had met the DIYAbility team when we were in New York for the [Hackaday contest](http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-hackaday/), and found that we shared a lot of common ground. DIYAbility is working with people with disabilities and supporting them in becoming makers, and have released accessible video game controls, DJ tables controlled by a wheelchair, and other innovations. They too are connecting people with disabilities to makers to create positive change in the lives of people with disabilities.

If you happen to be in San Diego that week, come visit our session, "[The Maker Movement and Assistive Technology](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2017/sessions/index.php/public/presentations/view/331)" at 2:20 pm Thursday, March 2nd.
