title: Remembering Stephen Hawking

---
We are sad to hear of the passing of Stephen Hawking. Along with being one of the most brilliant minds of his time, he was also a steadfast advocate of assistive technology. He insisted that the technology which helped him communicate be open-source, in order to be accessible to everyone who needed it.

In honour of Professor Hawking, CBC's The Current aired a segment on assistive technology. Dr. Gary Birch, Executive Director of the Neil Squire Society, was fortunate to be a guest on the show. You can <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/meet-the-woman-who-saved-stephen-hawking-s-voice-and-then-gave-the-technology-away-to-those-in-need-1.4583922">listen to the segment here</a>.

PS: The system Intel developed for Professor Hawking is publicly available as the Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT). You can explore the <a href="https://github.com/intel/acat">ACAT files on GitHub</a>. Open-source technology is a big part of our work at Makers Making Change, so we believe this is useful and important.
