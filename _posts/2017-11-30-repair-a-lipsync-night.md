title: Repair a LipSync Night

---
On Monday, December 4th, we'll be at <a title="Visit the Vancouver Hack Space website" href="http://vanhack.ca/wp/" target="_blank">Vancouver Hack Space</a> to fix some LipSyncs. We've held a number of buildathons over the past year at schools, at corporate team-building events, and in makerspaces. Some of the LipSyncs built at these events need a bit more work before they are released into the wild.

If you can solder, have some technical troubleshooting skills, and have some time, help us fix a LipSync or two!
