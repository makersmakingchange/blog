title: Coming Up: TELUS LipSync Buildathon

---

<p>This Friday, October 27th, we’ll be in sunny Calgary for the TELUS LipSync Buildathon. Around 20 TELUS employees will work together to build 20 LipSyncs, supported by Makers Making Change. Teams will be supplied with the tools, components, parts and instructions.</p>

<p>We will also have the pleasure of meeting The Honourable Kent Hehr, Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, again, as he talks about the role of makers of assistive technology in creating opportunities for people with disabilities. He had previously met us as part of our travels for the <a title="Learn more about the TOM:Calgary Makeathon" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-tomcalgary-lipsync-buildathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><abbr title="Tikkun Olam Makers">TOM</abbr>:Calgary Makeathon</a> in August earlier this year.</p>
