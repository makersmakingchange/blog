The funding is a part of the $22.3-million <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/programs/accessible-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accessible Technology Program</a>, which provides support for the development of assistive and adaptive digital devices and technologies to help Canadians with disabilities take full advantage of technology.

The funding will allow us to continue developing an open-source assistive technology model across Canada that greatly reduces the cost of many assistive devices. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2018/05/government-of-canada-funds-digital-technologies-to-improve-accessibility-for-canadians-with-disabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the full press release on the Government of Canada website.</a>
