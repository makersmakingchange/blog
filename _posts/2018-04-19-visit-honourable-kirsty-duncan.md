Every week is science week at <a href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makers Making Change</a>. We really hopped on the science train this past week, though.
<h3>A Visit from the Minister</h3>
On April 12th, we were thrilled to welcome the Honourable Kirsty Duncan, Minister of Science and Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, to the <a title="Visit the Neil Squire Society website" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/" rel="noopener">Neil Squire Society</a>’s Burnaby Head Office. We showcased the <a title="Learn more about the LipSync" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2800937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LipSync</a> and other low-tech assistive devices such as a pen holder and nail clipper holder.

<h3><abbr title="Science and Technology Awareness Network">STAN</abbr> Conference</h3>
On April 11th, Chad was the keynote speaker at the <a title="Visit the STAN Website" href="http://www.stanrsst.ca/stan-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><abbr title="Science and Technology Awareness Network">STAN</abbr> 2018</a> conference here in Vancouver.

<h3>Science World Community Scientist Initiative</h3>
We were back at Science World on April 15th when Jake, our Mechanical Engineer, hosted a booth as part of the Community Scientist Initiative. The initiative gives all Science World visitors an opportunity to meet and learn from a science-based professional.
