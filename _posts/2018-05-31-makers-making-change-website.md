title: New Makers Making Change Website

---
We are thrilled to officially invite you to the shiny new Makers Making Change website: <a href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com">www.makersmakingchange.com</a>. Our goal was to facilitate more community level collaboration, which is why the homepage will greet you with a feature allowing you to search for makers, project requests, or events in your area.

If you navigate to the <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projects</a> section of the website, youâ€™ll find some projects uploaded by makers and marked as ideas, prototypes, or complete. You can contribute your skills to work on projects in progress. If you have a disability and feel a certain project will improve your life, you can request a build.

Our hope is that more people sign up and share projects that can help people with disabilities. We encourage you to spend some time on the website, browse projects, and connect with some amazing people.
