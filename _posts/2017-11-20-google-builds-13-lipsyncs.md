title: Google Builds 13 LipSyncs

---

The LipSync project is funded by <a title="Visit the Google.org website" href="www.google.org" target="_blank">Google.org</a>. Members of our <a title="Visit the Makers Making Change website" href="www.makersmakingchange.com" target="_blank">Makers Making Change</a> team  headed down to Google <abbr title="headquarters">HQ</abbr> in Mountain View, California, for a Buildathon! Google was celebrating Accessibility Week and we joined them on Wednesday and Thursday, November 1st and 2nd.

Eight organizations in the accessibility sphere, including the Neil Squire Society, were invited on Wednesday. On Thursday, Google staff built 13 LipSyncs for people with disabilities.

Here are some photos from the event:

We worked in an area called <a title="Read more about The Garage at Google" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-googles-the-garage-lab-2016-6" target="_blank">The Garage</a>, a workshop space with a lot of equipment and tools.
