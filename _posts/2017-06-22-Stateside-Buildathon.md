title: Stateside Buildathon

---

We hadn’t done a Buildathon in the United States yet. So why not do two of them on the same day in opposite ends of the country? That’s what we did Sunday, as part of the <a title="go to the Nation of Makers website" href="https://nationofmakers.us/" target="_blank">Nation of Makers</a>’ <a title="go to the Week of Making website" href="http://www.weekofmaking.org/" target="_blank">Week of Making</a>, with Buildathons in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Seattle, Washington.

It was fantastic.

<strong><em>Above: Seeing that both Buildathons fell on Father’s Day, it was only fitting that we had a father-daughter team. Scott, our <a title="read my previous Update on when Scott built his first LipSync" href="http://www.neilsquire.ca/latest-news/technology-news/lipsync-update-comcast/">friend from Comcast who built one on his own initiative</a>, pictured with his daughter.</em></strong>

<strong><em>Below: We’ve typically done red LipSyncs, but while we’re trying new things, why not switch it up with the colours.</em></strong>

In Philadelphia, where we partnered with <a title="go to the NextFab website" href="https://nextfab.com/" target="_blank">NextFab</a> (who hosted us at their Philadelphia location), we got to say hi (and build LipSyncs) with a few old friends. Scott from Comcast brought along his daughter, and they built a LipSync.

As well, a few of the people who we had dropped off LipSyncs with last time actually built one themselves. Charles, from <a title="go to the Inglis House website" href="https://www.inglis.org/programs-and-services/inglis-house" target="_blank">Inglis House</a>, and Russ, from the <a title="go to the Institute of Disabilities website" href="http://www.temple.edu/instituteondisabilities/" target="_blank">Institute of Disabilities</a> at <a title="go to the Temple University website" href="http://www.temple.edu/" target="_blank">Temple University</a>, both got to build a LipSync and take them home. It was great not only to give them a LipSync, but show them how they can make it themselves.

<em>“[Chad Leaman], Ivan and the rest of the team did a phenomenal job putting together the Buildathon this past weekend,”</em> Russ, who received four LipSyncs for the <a title="go to the Pennsylvania's Initiative on Assistive Technology website" href="http://disabilities.temple.edu/programs/assistive/piat/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania's Initiative on Assistive Technology</a>, wrote us in an email. <em>“The LipSyncs produced will, no doubt, be put to good use in our Statewide AT lending library.”</em>

In Seattle, at the <a title="go to the SoDo MakerSpace website" href="http://sodomakerspace.com/" target="_blank">SoDo MakerSpace</a>, we also had a great time. In all, we ended the weekend with 21 LipSyncs built.

Buildathons weren’t the only thing we were doing in the States. Our Executive Director, Gary Birch, was in Washington DC, as a panelist at the <a title="learn more about the M-Enabling Summit" href="http://www.m-enabling.com/" target="_blank">M-Enabling Summit</a>. In addition to talking to a large audience of influential persons and industry leaders about the LipSync and Makers Making Change, Birch also met some important contacts – he paid a visit to <a title="learn more about MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedStar_National_Rehabilitation_Hospital" target="_blank">MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital</a>, and met with John Anschutz, the manager of the Assistive Technology Center at the <a title="go to the Shepherd Center website" href="https://www.shepherd.org/" target="_blank">Shepherd Center</a>, one of the best rehabilitation hospitals in the world. He gave them both LipSyncs.

<em>Our travels are not over. We’re at the <a title="learn more about the conference" href="https://www.caot.ca/site/pd/conf2017?nav=sidebar" target="_blank">2017 Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists conference</a> right now. With the success of the American one in Philadelphia — the connections we made were why we were there on Sunday — we hope to find the same in Charlottetown, <abbr title="Prince Edward Island">PEI</abbr>. We’ll meet with occupational therapists from all over Canada, as well as some local makerspaces, and give out a few LipSyncs.</em>
