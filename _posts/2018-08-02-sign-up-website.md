That’s it! Now click on <a title="Connect with makers in your area" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect</a> in the sidebar to search for makers, project requests, or events in your area. Explore the open-source <a title="View the projects library" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projects</a> library and make a device for a person with a disability. Or upload your own project or idea.

If you have a disability and feel a certain project will improve your life, you can request a build. We’ll connect you with a maker in your community who can build the device for you.

Let's collaborate!
