---
We had a wonderful time at the Acadia University LipSync Buildathon on February 1st. It was a day of teamwork and learning as scores of students came together to build 36 <a title="Learn more about the LipSync" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com/lipsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LipSyncs</a>.

Around 60 engineering students participated in building the LipSyncs. Of them, over 30 volunteered their time to help others build, including mentoring 25 Wolfville School students from Grades 7 and 8.
