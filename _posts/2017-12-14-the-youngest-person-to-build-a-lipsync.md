title: The Youngest Person to Build a LipSync

---
We were in Calgary last weekend for a buildathon with <a title="Visit the STEM Learning Lab website" href="http://stemlearninglab.com/" target="_blank">STEM Learning Lab</a>. Around 25 West Island College students attended to help out, of whom only three had soldered before. But they were such brilliantly quick learners that by the end of the day, they had built 17 LipSyncs together.

Although the students worked in teams, an 11-year-old named Isabel built a device all by herself! She’s the youngest person yet to build a LipSync.

Our speaker at the event was Mike, who has <a title="Learn more about ALS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis" target="_blank">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease). He has been inventing a range of devices to help him increase his independence.

Mike brought with him his newest prototype, which is designed as a forklift for plates. It allows him to pick up a plate, put it into a microwave, take it out, and then bring it to his foot-controlled feeding device.
