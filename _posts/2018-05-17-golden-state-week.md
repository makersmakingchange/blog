<h3><strong>Laser Cutting Keyguards Workshop (May 22nd)</strong></h3>

We're making the most of our stay in the Bay Area and hosting this workshop in partnership with the Communication Technology Education Center (CTEC) and HackerLab.

Keyguards can be very useful for people with disabilities, helping them control their input and address mobility and agility issues. We're sending our best laser cutter, Jake, to lead this workshop.
