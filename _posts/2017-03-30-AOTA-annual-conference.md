title: 2017 AOTA Annual Conference

---

We’re in Philadelphia this week at the 2017 AOTA (American Occupational Therapists Association) Annual Conference, which will also be celebrating the 100th anniversary of the AOTA. In front of over 13,000 occupational therapists, we are promoting the LipSync and “making” to create access solutions for people with disabilities.

<em><strong>We’ll be at the 2017 AOTA Annual Conference from March 30-April 2.</strong></em> 

Occupational therapists are one of our biggest audiences in terms of outreach, as they recommend and apply assistive technology solutions to their clients. This conference is our best chance to reach occupational therapists all across North America, and create opportunities for the LipSync and other open source assistive technologies to be made outside our local base.

We brought with us a small, “homemade” 3D printer to show off at our exhibit during the conference.

Outside of the conference, the trip will give us a chance to meet and network with local groups, including Pennsylvania's Initiative on Assistive Technology (PIAT) and Magee Rehabilitation Hospital, which specializes in spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury.

It’s going to be a great weekend of connecting with local experts, and working to advance our goal of connecting people with disabilities to makers across North America.
