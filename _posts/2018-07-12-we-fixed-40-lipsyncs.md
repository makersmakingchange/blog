title: We Fixed 40 LipSyncs

---
On Thursday, July 5th, <a title="Visit the Makers Making Change website" href="http://www.makersmakingchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makers Making Change</a> was at <a title="Visit the Vancouver Hack Space website" href="http://www.vhs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vancouver Hack Space</a> to repair a few <a title="Learn more about the LipSync" href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/lipsync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LipSyncs</a>. In just a few hours, around 12 volunteers helped us troubleshoot and fix 40 LipSyncs.

We can now send these completed LipSyncs to people with disabilities who need them. Thank you to everyone who came out to help!
