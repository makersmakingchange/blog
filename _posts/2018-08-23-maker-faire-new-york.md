At Maker Faire, Chad Leaman, Director of Innovation, will also be on a panel centred on making assistive technologies for people with disabilities. He will be joining these brilliant makers:
<ul>
 	<li>Jon Schull of <a title="Visit the e-NABLE website" href="http://e-nable.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-NABLE</a>, a network of volunteers creating free open-source 3D printed prosthetics for children and underserved populations</li>
 	<li>Holly Cohen of <a title="Learn more about DIYAbility" href="https://www.diyability.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIYAbility</a>, which empowers people to not only to make access solutions for people with disabilities, but to also help people with disabilities be makers</li>
 	<li>Liz Arum of <a title="Visit the Ultimaker website" href="https://ultimaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimaker</a>, who is 3D printing resources for blind students</li>
</ul>
We’re interested in organizing a small <strong>LipSync Buildathon</strong> or two in the week after Maker Faire in the New York area and on the East Coast. If you’d like to be involved, please email Chad at <a title="Email Chad" href="mailto:chadl@neilsquire.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chadl@neilsquire.ca</a>.

We look forward to seeing you there!
