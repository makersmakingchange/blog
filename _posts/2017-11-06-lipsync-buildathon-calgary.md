title: LipSync Buildathon with TELUS in Calgary

---

We were in Calgary for our LipSync Buildathon with TELUS on Friday, October 27, followed by a trip to the <a title="Learn more about the Maker Faire Calgary" href="https://calgary.makerfaire.com/" target="_blank">Maker Faire Calgary</a> over the weekend.

At the Buildathon, we worked with TELUS staff to build 25 LipSyncs. The Honourable Kent Hehr, Minister of Sport and People with Disabilities, attended our event to speak about the role of makers of assistive technology in creating opportunities for people with disabilities.
